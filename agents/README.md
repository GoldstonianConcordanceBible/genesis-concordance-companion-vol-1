# Divine Companion Agents (Standard Pack)

These agents are a reusable system that ships with every Goldstonian book companion repo.
They produce consistent outputs aligned to the Goldstonian Spine:

Purpose Thesis → Narrative Flow → Core Theology → Messiah Thread → Cross-Links → Hard Questions → Preacher’s Toolkit → Walking Rule

## How to use
1) Pick a passage range (or whole-book scope).
2) Run Agent 01 first (Spine Architect) to establish structure and tags.
3) Run Agents 02–07 to fill modules.
4) Run Agent 08 to package a DOI-ready release bundle.
5) Run Agent 09 to verify quality + consistency.

## Output locations
- companion/ (main manuscript sections)
- vocab/ (controlled vocabulary, keywords)
- data/crosswalks/ (cross-links dataset)
- data/evidence/ (evidence index)
- release/ (bundle rules + checksums)
