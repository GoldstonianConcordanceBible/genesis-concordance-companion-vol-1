# Agent 07: Messiah Thread Mapper — Genesis (Populated)

Inserted in companion/GENESIS-CONCORDANCE-COMPANION.md section 4.

Key Messiah-thread claims (pattern vs fulfillment clarity):
1) Seed promise begins the rescue horizon (Gen 3:15) — pattern announced; later framed as ultimate defeat of evil (Rom 16:20).
2) Abrahamic blessing is nations-focused (Gen 12:1–3) — doctrine lane in Gal 3:6–9.
3) Substitution logic intensifies (Gen 22) — pattern of provision; later theological lane for faith and sacrifice (Heb 11:17–19; Jas 2:21–23).
4) Judah line emerges (Gen 49:8–12) — kingship horizon; later messianic reading lane (Rev 5:5).
5) Joseph pattern: rejected → exalted → many preserved (Gen 37–50; esp. Gen 45:5–8; 50:20) — narrative/pattern lane in Acts 7:9–14.
6) Eden as “presence place” sets exile/return logic (Gen 3:23–24) — later temple and restoration arcs (Rev 22:1–5).
7) Babel vs Pentecost: scattering vs Spirit-gathering (Gen 11:1–9) — contrast lane in Acts 2.
8) Covenant name-making: humans seek a name (Gen 11:4), God gives a name (Gen 12:2) — mission lane in Matt 28:18–20.
