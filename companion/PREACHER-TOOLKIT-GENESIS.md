# Preacher’s Toolkit — Genesis

## A) 8-week series (Origins to Promise)
1. **Created for Purpose** (Gen 1–2) — God’s order; human calling
2. **Rupture and Hope** (Gen 3) — fall; seed promise
3. **Worship vs Violence** (Gen 4) — offerings; the spread of sin
4. **Judgment & Mercy** (Gen 6–9) — flood; covenant stability
5. **Babel & the Nations** (Gen 10–11) — pride; scattering
6. **Called to Bless** (Gen 12) — Abraham; nations
7. **Faith Counted Righteous** (Gen 15) — covenant; trust
8. **Providence That Preserves** (Gen 37–50) — Joseph; saving many

## B) 4-week “Messiah Thread in Genesis”
1. Seed promise (Gen 3)
2. Covenant blessing (Gen 12)
3. Provided substitute (Gen 22)
4. Joseph pattern (Gen 45; 50)

## C) Turning points to emphasize
- Gen 3: fracture + promise
- Gen 11–12: Babel to Abraham (empire to covenant)
- Gen 15: faith counted righteous
- Gen 22: testing/substitution pattern
- Gen 50: providence summary

## D) Common misreads to warn against
- Treating Genesis only as debate material, missing discipleship purpose
- Reading election as superiority rather than service-to-nations
- Ignoring the “promise line” that holds the narrative together
