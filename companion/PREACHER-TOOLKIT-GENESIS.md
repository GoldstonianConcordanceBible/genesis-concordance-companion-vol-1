## D) Common misreads to warn against (8)
- Reading Genesis only as debate material instead of discipleship foundation
- Treating election as superiority, not mission (Gen 12)
- Ignoring seed/covenant as the narrative spine
- Missing that judgment and mercy travel together
- Turning Joseph into “success tips” rather than providence and preservation
- Moralizing patriarch stories without seeing covenant formation
- Skipping genealogies as “filler” instead of promise-line mapping
- Forgetting Eden/exile logic that shapes the rest of Scripture
